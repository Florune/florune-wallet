## Introduction

**Florune** is an non-custodial wallet and official inteface of ContractFoundry ecosystem, ContractFoundry is an **Smart Contract-as-a-Service (SCaaS)** platform providing **trustless, non-custodial smart contract infrastructure** that empowers users to manage **payments, agreements, and data verification** securely—without intermediaries or centralized authority.

By combining **escrow and pledge contracts**, **onchain document verification**, **verifiable credentials**, and **decentralized identity (DID)**, Florune enables individuals and enterprises to interact directly onchain with full ownership of their assets, documents, and digital identity.

The ecosystem—comprising **escrow contracts, pledge contracts, verifiable documents, document registry, credentials registry, DID registry, user management, and subscription services**—is now **fully live on Polygon**, enabling real-world, enterprise-grade trustless interactions.

This architecture delivers a **secure, censorship-resistant, and fraud-proof ecosystem** where agreements, payments, and verifications are automated and self-sovereign.

---

## Mission and Vision

Our mission is to build a world where individuals and organizations have **complete sovereignty** over their assets, data, and digital identity—empowering them to engage in **trustless, borderless agreements** without dependence on intermediaries.

We envision a future where **privacy, security, and autonomy** are built into every transaction, enabling **decentralized collaboration** at scale. By combining blockchain, verifiable credentials, and decentralized identity, Florune redefines how people transact, verify, and trust—onchain and on their own terms.

## Florune Wallet: The Secure Gateway to the ContractFoundry Ecosystem

Florune Wallet is the official, non-custodial interface for the Contract Foundry ecosystem, engineered to provide users with direct and sovereign control over their onchain agreements and assets. It functions as the primary command center for interacting with ecosystem smart contracts, enabling the management of digital identity, the execution of legally-binding document signatures, and the autonomous control of financial obligations and subscriptions.

Architected with security as its foundation, the wallet ensures all cryptographic operations from private key management to transaction and document signing are processed locally on the user's device. Private keys are secured within a multi-encryption-layered local database and never leave the client environment. Developed according to stringent secure coding principles, this design eliminates central points of failure, guaranteeing that users retain absolute, non-custodial control over their data and funds while engaging with the enterprise-grade capabilities of the Contract Foundry.
